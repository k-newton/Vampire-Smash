# Vampire Smash Game File

The main vampire-smash.html file contains the complete self-contained game. This file is quite large (~127KB) and contains:

1. All game code integrated into a single file
2. All scene implementations
3. All procedural asset generation code
4. Physics and gameplay mechanics

Due to size limitations in the GitHub API, this file needs to be uploaded directly through git or the GitHub web interface rather than through the API.

3. Add, commit, and push the file:
   ```

## File Structure

The vampire-smash.html file is structured as follows:

- Embedded Phaser 3 library
- Scene class implementations
- Entity class implementations
- Asset generation functions

This self-contained approach allows the game to be played without any external dependencies.
